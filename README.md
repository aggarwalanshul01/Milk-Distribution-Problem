# Milk-Distribution-Problem(WITH AUTHENTICATION)
This is based on the real time problem of milk distribution by the milkman. It helps the milkman by giving him/her the most optimal path in 2 conditions-
1) When milkman acts as single milk man.
2) When milkman ascts as a factory.

For single milkman we are using Floyd algorithm (TSP CAN ALSO BE A GOOD OPTION BUT HERE WE ARE GIVING MORE PRIORITY TO WEIGHT OF MILK) and for factory we are using Prim's Algorithm with automatic generation of graphs with simple view.
